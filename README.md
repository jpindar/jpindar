Embedded systems designer who has worked extensively in the rf/microwave/wireless
industry, and has experience with the full software & firmware development cycle as
well as hands-on experience in electronics manufacturing.

I have a distraction-free remote work environment including a basic electronics lab.

I am currently seeking any remote employment or freelance work, not necessarily related to embedded systems.
